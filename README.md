# PS02: Duplicating zeros

Given a list of integers `arr`, modify it such that every 0 appears twice while maintaining the original list size. Modify the list in place.

**Example 1**:
* **Input**: `[1,0,2,3,0,4,5,0]`
* **Output**: `None`
* **Why?**: After calling your solution, the input array is modified to `[1,0,0,2,3,0,0,4]`.

# How to submit

* Complete the function `duplicate_zeros` under `solution.py`
* Push your changes to `feedback`.
* Your code must be readable, [**https://www.pylint.org/**](https://www.pylint.org/) checks will be run against each push.
* Your code must pass all test cases. `grader.py` will be run against all input test cases inside `test_cases/`
* Enjoy ðŸ’•!.

# Debugging

* You can run a test case py running `python grader.py < test_cases/TEST` where `TEST` is the particular test case you want to run.
